As I step into college, a fresh start,
I carry with me my coding art.
Python, Java, HTML, and more,
Skills I've honed, ones I adore.

But my ambitions don't stop there,
I aim to go beyond, to dare.
To learn A.I., cybersecurity too,
And OSINT techniques, oh so new.

My hunger for knowledge, never quenched,
To personal development, I'm entrenched.
To fine-tune skills, old and new,
To reach new heights, is what I'll do.

As I navigate this path, with grit and grace,
I'll face the challenges, and set the pace.
And as I look ahead, I can see,
A future bright, with endless possibility.

In the words of Bukowski, I say,
"I don't know about other people, but when I wake up in the morning and put my shoes on, I think, 'Jesus Christ, now what?'"
But I'm ready for what's in store,
My coding journey, I'll explore.
