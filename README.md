### About Me
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a young and enthusiastic software developer with a passion for cybersecurity and OSINT. I have experience in Python, Java, SQL, Docker, Notion, LaTeX, and Linux, and I'm constantly learning new technologies and techniques.

### My Journey
My journey in software development started when I was still in high school. I took a coding course, and I was immediately hooked. I loved the way code could be used to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. <br>
Never thought that such as small decision might alter the course of ones life. <br>
Since then, I've been learning as much as I can about programming, cybersecurity, and OSINT.

### My Ambitions
As a young software developer, my ultimate ambition is to become a cybersecurity expert and contribute to the fight against cybercrime. I believe that cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges of our time, and I'm determined to play my part in solving it.

In particular, I'm interested in OSINT techniques, which I believe can be a powerful tool in cybersecurity. By gathering and analyzing publicly available information, we can identify potential threats and prevent attacks before they happen.

I'm also passionate about learning AI and its applications in cybersecurity and other fields. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and solve complex problems that were previously impossible to tackle.

Overall, my ambition is to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society and contribute to the advancement of technology, especially in the fields of cybersecurity and OSINT.
